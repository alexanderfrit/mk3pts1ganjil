              Hi there! My name is Alexander Fritz Isaie and I'm a 10th grader
              at SMK Telkom Purwokerto. I'm excited to share a little bit about
              myself with you. I was born in Bogor and currently live in
              Cilacap, i enjoy doing little bit of anything, and this portfolio
              is for my school project. Throughout my high school years, I've
              developed a passion for Coding, Designing, Cloud Computing and
              such. When I'm not working on school projects or pursuing my
              interests, I enjoy basically chilling at home. I created this
              portfolio to showcase my skills and experiences, and to share my
              journey as a high school student. I hope you'll enjoy exploring my
              portfolio and getting to know me a little better. Thank you for
              stopping by!

          <h3>Semester 1</h3>
          <h4>----</h4>
          <p>
            During my first year of high school, I had the opportunity to dive
            into the world of coding and develop a foundational understanding of
            the principles behind programming languages, especially C#. I spent
            a lot of time working on mockups and prototypes using Figma, which
            helped me to understand the importance of user experience in
            software development. Through these experiences, I gained valuable
            skills that have helped me to grow as a coder and prepared me for
            more advanced coding challenges in the future.

          <h3>Semester 2</h3>
          <h4>----</h4>
          <p>
            As I continued my journey in coding, I decided to take on more
            advanced challenges. I began learning about cloud computing and
            cybersecurity, which helped me understand the importance of secure
            coding practices and data privacy. Additionally, I started
            practicing and working with Ubuntu server, which allowed me to gain
            experience with Linux-based systems and broaden my technical
            expertise. Through these experiences, I have gained confidence in my
            ability to tackle complex coding challenges and continue to grow my
            skills in the field of technology.

        <h4>Kindergarten - Elementary school</h4>
        <p>
          In kindergarten, I was introduced to the basics of education, such as
          learning the alphabet, numbers, and colors. I also developed important
          social skills, such as sharing and working in groups, which laid the
          foundation for my future academic and personal success. Throughout
          elementary school, I gained a strong foundation in math, reading, and
          writing, which helped me to develop critical thinking and
          problem-solving skills. I also explored a variety of subjects, such as
          science, history, and art, which expanded my horizons and encouraged
          me to pursue my interests. Additionally, I developed important social
          skills, such as communication and teamwork, through group projects and
          extracurricular activities like sports and music.

          During my senior high school years, I deepened my knowledge and skills
          in various areas of technology. I learned to code using C#, worked
          with Adobe Illustrator to create mockups, and prototyped in Figma to
          understand user experience in software development. Additionally, I
          gained experience with cloud computing and explored Ubuntu server and
          Apache, gaining valuable experience in Linux-based systems and web
          development. These experiences helped me to build a strong foundation
          in technology and prepared me for further challenges in the field, and
          I'm grateful for the guidance of my teachers and peers during this

                My Figma prototype is a high-fidelity interactive designed to
                resemble the user interface of Steam, a popular video game
                distribution platform, but with a unique greenish and black
                color scheme. The layout features prominent placement of
                featured games, user account information, and social features,
                closely resembling the Steam platform. However, the chosen color
                scheme creates a futuristic and edgy vibe, enhancing the user
                experience and making the platform feel more immersive and
                engaging.

                My first drink can mockup was created in Adobe Illustrator using
                basic shapes, colors, and gradients. The design features a light
                green, white, and black color scheme that is visually appealing

                and eye-catching.
